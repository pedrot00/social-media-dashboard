# Social Media Dashboard

## Description
The "Social Media Dashboard" project is a web page that provides an overview of information from various social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Developed as part of a learning process, this project uses React, JSX, componentization and hooks technologies to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JSX:** JavaScript extension syntax used in React.
- **Componentization:** Dividing the code into independent and reusable components.
- **Hooks:** Using React hooks for state management and lifecycle.
- **Social Network APIs:** Integration with public APIs from Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to obtain profile data.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dashboard-social-media.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd dashboard-social-media
```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
4. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```
5. **Open your browser and go to:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
